# TNW-Reuma.pt

Scripts of the two experiments presented in the work IIEEC_Report_75249.pdf

Experiment 1 - Biological therapy sequences:

encoder_sequence.py - python file to transform data from a csv file into temporal sequences 
temporal_reuma.py - python file that performs the alignments using TNW algorithm and Hierarchical Clustering

Experiment 2 - DAS28 sequences

encoder_sequence_das.py 
temporal_reuma_das.py

The user-defined parameters such as the gap penalty, the scoring schema, temporal penalty function, clustering distance measure are all defined manually in the scripts
